## Getting started

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cbnusw/cbnuoss_2023_frontend.git
```

#### Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies
Open a new terminal window, and run the following command to install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd cbnuoss_2023_frontend
```

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 3: Check the Environment File

- Add a file named `.env.local` in the `cbnuoss_2023_frontend` directory.
> This file will store the environment variables required for the project to run. You may refer to `.env-help` for guidance on setting up these variables.

#### Step 4: Run the Frontend Server

After installing the frontend dependencies and checking the environment file, run the following command in the same terminal to start the frontend server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

This command will start the frontend server, and you'll be able to access the website on `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
